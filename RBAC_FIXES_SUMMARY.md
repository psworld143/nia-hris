# RBAC Access and Permission Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-01-20

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Manage Degrees Access Issue

**Problem:**
- Users with `super_admin` role could not access Manage Degrees functionality
- When attempting to add a degree, system redirected to dashboard
- Could not deactivate existing degrees

**Root Cause:**
Inconsistent role checks across related files:
- `manage-degrees.php` allowed: `super_admin`, `admin`, `hr_manager` ✅
- `add-degree.php` allowed: `admin`, `human_resource`, `hr_manager` ❌ (missing `super_admin`)
- `toggle-degree-status.php` allowed: `admin`, `human_resource`, `hr_manager` ❌ (missing `super_admin`)

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `add-degree.php` to include `super_admin` in role check
- Updated `toggle-degree-status.php` to include `super_admin` in role check
- Standardized role permissions to: `['super_admin', 'admin', 'hr_manager']`

**Files Modified:**
- `/add-degree.php` - Line 7
- `/toggle-degree-status.php` - Line 8

### 2. ✅ Unauthorized Access on Leave Module

**Problem:**
- Users without permission could access the "Add Leave" function
- Access control was not properly enforced

**Root Cause:**
- `create-leave-request-form.php` used basic role check instead of RBAC functions
- `create-leave-request.php` was missing `super_admin` in role check
- Form was accessible to HR users who should use `leave-management.php` instead

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `create-leave-request-form.php` to:
  - Use RBAC functions (`isEmployee()`)
  - Redirect HR users to `leave-management.php` (proper page for adding leave for employees)
  - Only allow `employee` role to use this form (self-service)
- Updated `create-leave-request.php` to include `super_admin` in role check

**Files Modified:**
- `/create-leave-request-form.php` - Lines 9-19
- `/create-leave-request.php` - Line 23

**Access Control:**
- **Employee Role**: Uses `create-leave-request-form.php` to request their own leave
- **HR Roles** (super_admin, admin, hr_manager, hr_staff): Use `leave-management.php` to add leave for any employee

### 3. ✅ Quick Action "Add Employee" Error

**Problem:**
- "Add Employee" via Quick Action on dashboard resulted in an error
- Link pointed to API endpoint instead of form page

**Root Cause:**
- Quick action link in `index.php` pointed to `add-employee.php` (API endpoint returning JSON)
- Should point to `admin-employee.php` (actual management page with form)

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated dashboard quick action link from `add-employee.php` to `admin-employee.php`

**Files Modified:**
- `/index.php` - Line 149

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Manage Degrees Testing
- [ ] Login as `super_admin` and verify access to Manage Degrees page
- [ ] Test adding a new degree
- [ ] Test editing an existing degree
- [ ] Test deactivating a degree
- [ ] Test activating a deactivated degree
- [ ] Verify `hr_manager` role can access all functions
- [ ] Verify `human_resource` role is properly blocked

### 2. Leave Module Testing
- [ ] Login as `employee` and verify access to leave request form
- [ ] Submit a leave request as employee
- [ ] Login as `hr_manager` and verify redirect to `leave-management.php`
- [ ] Verify HR users can add leave for employees via leave-management page
- [ ] Verify unauthorized users cannot access leave creation

### 3. Dashboard Quick Actions Testing
- [ ] Login as any HR role

## Notes

- All role checks now consistently include `super_admin` where appropriate
- RBAC functions from `includes/roles.php` should be used for permission checks
- When adding new features, ensure role checks are consistent across related files
- HR users should use dedicated management pages (`leave-management.php`, etc.) rather than employee self-service forms
