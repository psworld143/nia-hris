# Sidebar Navigation Fix - Summary

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### **Problem:**
Super Admin sidebar had invalid redirect pages and all users saw all menu items regardless of their role.

### **Solution:**
Implemented role-based sidebar navigation with proper access controls.

## 🔐 Permission Enforcement

### **Files Updated:**
1. ✅ `includes/header.php` - Role-based sidebar navigation
2. ✅ `login.php` - Accepts all 5 roles
3. ✅ `index.php` - Accepts all 5 roles

### **Auto-Protected:**
All pages using `includes/header.php` now automatically have role functions available.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Menu Visibility Logic:**

```php
// Medical Records - Only for Super Admin and Nurse
<?php if (in_array($_SESSION['role'], ['super_admin', 'nurse'])): ?>
    <a href="medical-records.php">Medical Records</a>
<?php endif; ?>

// Salary Management - Only for Admin roles
<?php if (in_array($_SESSION['role'], ['super_admin', 'admin', 'hr_manager'])): ?>
    <a href="salary-structures.php">Salary Structures</a>
<?php endif; ?>

// Settings - Super Admin Only
<?php if ($_SESSION['role'] === 'super_admin'): ?>
    <a href="settings.php">Settings</a>
<?php endif; ?>
```

---

## ✅ Verification

### **Test Each Role:**

1. **Login as Super Admin** (`superadmin` / `Super@2024`)
   - Should see all menu items including Medical Records and Settings

2. **Login as Nurse** (`nurse1` / `Nurse@2024`)
   - Should see only Dashboard and Medical Records

3. **Login as HR Staff** (`hrstaff` / `HRStaff@2024`)
   - Should see limited menu (no salary, no departments management)

4. **Login as Admin** (`admin` / `admin123`)
   - Should see most items except Settings and Medical Records

## 🚀 What's Different Now
